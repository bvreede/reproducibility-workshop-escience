# Merton's Scientific Norms

- **Communalism**: scientific results are the common property of the community. 

- **Universalism**: all scientists can contribute to science regardless of race, nationality, culture, or gender.

- **Disinterestedness**: act for the benefit of a common scientific enterprise, rather than for personal gain.

- **Skepticism**: scientific claims must be exposed to critical scrutiny before being accepted.

_Robert K. Merton, 1942_

# The Reproducibility crisis

# Replication vs. reproduction

- **computationally reproducible** means: with same code + same data + same environment
== same results

- Not the same as **replication**, where _different_ methods and _different_ data lead to the same research findings

# Reproducibility issues == research waste

![](images/research_waste.png)
There are many reasons for problems in reproducibility. Each requires its own approach. All lead to a loss of time, effort, resources, credence: **research waste**.

# Why is this happening?

#### Perverse incentives embedded in the system

- Little funding, lots of people: a highly competitive system
- Publication pressure: "Publish or Perish"
- Selective reporting: positive over negative outcomes, and novelty over replication.

--

#### Researchers are, ahem, human!

- Humans are biased to see patterns, even where none exist
- Subject to confirmation bias for pet theories/convictions
- Not immune to outside pressure
- Limited time, limited resources
- Researchers are trained specialists, yet expected to be all-round excellent (spoiler alert: this is pretty hard)._

--

#### In short: Science is a human endeavour. 
Humans make choices, have biases, experience system pressure.

# Researcher degrees of freedom

Opportunistic use of researcher degrees of freedom when:
- Formulating hypotheses
- Designing the study
- Running the study
- Analyzing the data
- Reporting the study

# Self-cleaning nature of science

![](images/secondarypubs.png)

"Some non-reproducible preclinical papers had spawned an entire field, with hundreds of secondary publications that expanded on elements of the original observation, but did not actually seek to confirm or falsify its fundamental basis."

# The value of reproduction

Reproduction is a vital contribution to science: by preventing (further) research waste, and identifying the giants on whom to stand. Yet we keep them to ourselves.

# The Four Facets of Reproducibility

.pull-left-medium[
#### Documentation
What do you need to execute this project? Where do you start?

#### Organization
Demonstrate a trustworthy workflow.

#### Automation
Automated analyses trace your steps, and prevent human error (or at the very least: document it).

#### Dissemination
Share your data, release your code, publish your findings.]
