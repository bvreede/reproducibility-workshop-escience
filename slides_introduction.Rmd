# Be Reproducible!
.pull-left-medium[
What is reproducibility?

- **computationally reproducible** means: with same code + same data + same environment
== same results

- Not the same as **replication**, where _different_ methods and _different_ data lead to the same research findings

Why do you want to make your work reproducible?

- for whom?

- what do they gain?

- what do you gain?

# A great example
![example](images/screenshots/badexample.png)

# Is this enough?

- Access to the code
- Access to the data
- (And let's assume we can replicate the enviroment)

Do you feel confident about this project?
--

> This code is a kludgly, ugly, inefficient mess. 
(...)
>  It is probably riddled with problems, mistakes, bugs, inefficiencies, vestigial code stubs, etc etc.
(...)
> I am as confident as I am capable of being that all of the factual claims that were made in the manuscript are accurate.

We need to do more: we need to inspire trust.
- The code is correct (and I have made it easy for you/someone to check);
- My workflow is robust;
- My workflow *itself* is accessible, and I will be guiding you through it.

# What does a workflow look like?

![ds-workflow](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/raw/master/openscapes/environmental-data-science-r4ds-general.png)
- data cleaning is an essential first step
- think modular: each step requires own input, process, output

# What will we do today?

We will take you through a workflow (in a broader sense!)

--

- Setting up a project

- Establishing a robust backup / version control system

- Writing good code

- Writing documentation

- Making your project accessible

--

We will end by trying to reproduce each others' projects!

#### Do you have your own data/code?

If not: find an interesting dataset [on this github repo](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). How about:
- [space launches](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-01-15)
- [nobel prize winners](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-05-14)
- [cetaceans data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018/2018-12-18)

# What do we expect from you?

- Our group today has many different abilities and experiences. We hope you will value this as much as we do!

- Feel free and safe to share your expertise and experiences, either by helping your neighbor or by showing everyone.

--

#### Our objectives for you
We want to teach you **good habits** that will make your work more accessible, trustworthy, and reproducible by others. In doing so, we have tried to identify those habits that are a **good return on investment**: meaning, they save you time in the not-so-long run.
--
#### Give us feedback!

  - Does this tool/lesson align with the objectives of the course?
  
  - Do/did you have (access to) crucial basic information to understand our lessons?

  - If you do not know a certain word or term (or you think others may not know it): put it in the glossary, at [tinyurl.com/repco-glossary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UHBFyfvHoHXiV1Slr_DvxYDQyakozuPw_xPTJgeNInI/edit)

# Let's get practical!

- You can find the slides at [tinyurl.com/repcopilot](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/workshop-computational-reproducibility/). You may need links or code from these slides, so do open them.

- There's also a (tentative) schedule.

- This is a workshop, so do follow along! Use your sticky notes to signal to us: 
  - green means: I'm ready for the next step!
  - pink means: I need assistance, please.
