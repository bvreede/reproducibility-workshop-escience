# Be Reproducible!

What is reproducibility?

- **computationally reproducible** means: with same code + same data + same environment
== same results

- Not the same as **replication**, where _different_ methods and _different_ data lead to the same research findings

Why do you want to make your work reproducible?

- for whom?

- what do they gain?

- what do you gain?

# Is this enough?

- Access to the code
- Access to the data
- (And let's assume we can replicate the enviroment)

Do you feel confident about this project?
--

> This code is a kludgly, ugly, inefficient mess. 
(...)
>  It is probably riddled with problems, mistakes, bugs, inefficiencies, vestigial code stubs, etc etc.
(...)
> I am as confident as I am capable of being that all of the factual claims that were made in the manuscript are accurate.

We need to do more: we need to inspire trust.
- The code is correct (and I have made it easy for you/someone to check);
- My workflow is robust;
- My workflow *itself* is accessible, and I will be guiding you through it.

# What does a workflow look like?

![ds-workflow](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/raw/master/openscapes/environmental-data-science-r4ds-general.png)
- data cleaning is an essential first step
- think modular: each step requires own input, process, output

# Let's get practical!

- You can find the slides at [tinyurl.com/repcopilot](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/workshop-computational-reproducibility/). You may need links or code from these slides, so do open them.

- There's also a (tentative) schedule.

- This is a workshop, so do follow along! Use your sticky notes to signal to us: 
  - green means: I'm ready for the next step!
  - pink means: I need assistance, please.
